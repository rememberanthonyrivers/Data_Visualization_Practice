Data Visualization Practice Scripts
This repository contains practice scripts from the Data Visualization chapter, focusing on exploring and representing data through visualizations. These scripts aim to help users understand patterns and connections in data sets using Python's powerful visualization tools.

üìñ About This Chapter
Data visualization allows us to uncover the hidden patterns in data, making them accessible and meaningful through visual representations. This chapter covers:

Creating simple and visually appealing plots.
Working with numerical and nonnumerical data sets.
Exploring real-world applications of data visualization, such as genetics, climate research, and economic analysis.
With Python's efficiency, we can analyze data sets ranging from a few lines to millions of data points‚Äîall on a standard laptop.

üõ† Tools and Libraries Used
The scripts in this repository make use of the following libraries:

Matplotlib: A mathematical plotting library for creating:

Line graphs
Scatter plots
Random walk visualizations
Pygal: A library for interactive visualizations optimized for digital devices, allowing for:

Dynamic resizing for various devices (smartwatches to large monitors)
Interactive exploration of data (e.g., dice rolling simulations)

üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
A code editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)
Basic knowledge of Python programming

üìä Examples of Visualizations
Line Graphs: Visualize trends over time or sequential data.
Scatter Plots: Identify relationships between two variables.
Random Walks: Create dynamic paths based on random decisions.
Interactive Charts: Generate responsive visualizations for digital devices.
Dice Rolling Simulations: Explore probability through rolling multiple dice.
üåü Key Learning Outcomes
